Thank you for participating in this experiment :)
You can start the experiment using this link: https://maxheinemann.github.io/SQL_joins/
In the beginning, the experiment will ask you to read the how_to_solve_the_tasks.pdf. 
You will find it in the files in this repository.

Note: Press [ESC] while being in the training session to enter the testing session. There, the times for the 100 tasks will be measured.
